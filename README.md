# StudentMaxHeap-Project
This project implements a Max Heap data structure to manage and manipulate student records. The program provides functionality for storing students' details (roll numbers and CGPAs) in a max heap, allowing efficient operations like insertion, removal of the student with the highest CGPA, and level-order traversal.
It uses a console-based menu-driven interface for easy interaction with the heap. The heap prioritizes students based on their CGPA, and in case of a tie, the roll number is used as a secondary criterion.
